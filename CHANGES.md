Changelog
=========

0.4.0 (2025-02-XX)
------------------

### Changed

- Include demo links in the built-in documentation.


0.3.0 (2024-03-29)
------------------

### Fixed

- Ignore code embedded in URL when the code is longer than 64 bytes.
- Clear help pane on initialisation so that an error during
  initialisation does not leave the help pane visible.


0.2.0 (2023-12-24)
------------------

### Changed

- The frame interval set during the evaluation of the code at cell (0,
  0) determines the frame interval of the next iteration of
  evaluation.  The frame interval set during the evaluation of the
  code at other cells is ignored.
- Negative frame interval is considered an error.
- The README now clearly specifies that incrementing mode number to 3
  is an error.
